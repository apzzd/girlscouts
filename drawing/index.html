<h1>Girl Scouts: Drawing Badge</h1>

<p>Learn techniques to make your drawings even better.</p>

<h2>1. Experiment with different materials</h2>

	<p>I drew a picture of clouds with three different materials: charcoal, pencil, and oil pastel.</p>

<h2>2. Learn how to add shading</h2>

	<p>I drew a picture of an apple using 5 different shading techniques: shading, crosshatching, contour shading, scumbling, and smudging.</p>

<h2>3. Get some perspective</h2>

	<p>I made a <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apzzd/girlscouts/drawing/drawing/03-1-point-perspective-guide.pdf'>1-point perspective guide</a>. I read <i>Perspective! for Comic Book Artists</i> to find out more about perspective. I used depth cues like overlap, relative size, and atmospheric perspective to draw a picture of the Sandia Mountains. I used depth cues like the vanishing point, foreshortening, and relative size to draw a room.</p>

<h2>4. Use your imagination like a graphic artist</h2>

	<p>I made some blind contour drawings. See if you can guess what I was trying to draw!</p>

<h2>5. Make your masterpiece–and show it off!</h2>

	<p>I drew an oil pastel of a squirrel and some scratch art. I was showing off my artwork the whole time, because I was doing this badge with my grandmother over Zoom!</p>
